Well, it started about a half-hour before the wedding.\n(04:19-04:21): I was in this room with all the presents...\n(04:22-04:23): ...and I was looking at this gravy boat.\n(04:24-04:27): This really gorgeous Limoges gravy boat.\n(04:27-04:29): When all of a sudden... Sweet 'N Low?\n(04:29-04:31): I realized...\n(04:32-04:35): ...I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry.\n(04:36-04:39): Then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me:\n(04:39-04:42): How much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head.\n(04:42-04:45): You know, I mean, I always knew he looked familiar, but...\n(04:47-04:51): Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering:\n(04:51-04:55): Why am I doing this? And \"Who am I doing this for?\"\n(04:55-04:59): Anyway, I just didn't know where to go, and I know you and I have drifted apart...\n(04:59-05:02): ...but you're the only person I know in the city.\n(05:02-05:04): Who wasn't invited to the wedding.\n(05:04-05:07): Oh, I was kind of hoping that wouldn't be an issue.\n(05:22-05:24): I'm guessing he bought her the big pipe organ...\n(05:24-05:27): ...and she's really not happy about it.\n(05:28-05:31): Daddy, I just... I can't marry him.\n(05:31-05:33): I'm sorry.\n(05:33-05:36): I just don't love him.\n(05:36-05:39): Well, it matters to me.\n(05:42-05:44): She should not be wearing those pants.\n(05:45-05:47): I say push her down the stairs.\n(05:47-05:50): Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!\n(05:55-05:57): Come on, Daddy, listen to me!\n(05:57-06:01): It's like all of my life, everyone's always told me, \"You're a shoe!\n(06:02-06:04): You're a shoe! You're a shoe! You're a shoe!\"\n(06:04-06:07): Then today I stopped and said, \"What if I don't wanna be a shoe?\n(06:07-06:10): What if I wanna be a purse? You know?\n(06:11-06:12): Or a hat?\"\n(06:13-06:16): I don't want you to buy me a hat, I am a hat.\n(06:16-06:18): It's a metaphor, Daddy!\n(06:20-06:22): You can see where he'd have trouble.\n(06:25-06:27): Look, Daddy, it's my life.\n(06:28-06:31): Well, maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.\n(06:34-06:36): I guess we've established she's staying with Monica.\n(06:38-06:41): Well, maybe that's my decision.\n(06:42-06:44): Well, maybe I don't need your money.\n(06:44-06:46): Wait! Wait! I said maybe!\n(06:53-06:56): Okay. Just breathe, that's it.\n(06:56-06:58): Just try to think of nice, calm things.\n(06:59-07:02): Raindrops on roses And whiskers on kittens\n(07:03-07:07): Doorbells and sleigh bells And something with mittens\n(07:07-07:11): La la la something With string\n(07:11-07:13): I'm all better now.\n(07:15-07:17): I helped.\n(07:18-07:21): Look, this is probably for the best, you know?\n(07:21-07:24): Independence. Taking control of your life.\n(07:24-07:28): And, hey, if you need anything, you can always come to Joey.\n(07:28-07:32): Me and Chandler live right across the hall. And he's away a lot.\n(07:34-07:36): Joey, stop hitting on her. It's her wedding day.\n(07:36-07:39): What? Like there's a rule or something?\n(07:41-07:44): Please don't do that again. It's a horrible sound.\n(07:45-07:47): Uh, it's Paul.\n(07:45-07:47): Buzz him in.\n(07:47-07:50): Who's Paul?\n(07:47-07:50): Paul, the wine guy, Paul?\n(07:50-07:51): Maybe.\n(07:51-07:54): Wait a minute. Your \"not a real date\" is with Paul, the wine guy?\n(07:55-07:56): He finally asked you out?\n(07:55-07:56): Yes.\n(07:56-07:59): Ooh. This is a \"Dear Diary\" moment.\n(08:00-08:01): Rach, wait, I can cancel.\n(08:02-08:03): Please, no. Go, I'll be fine.\n(08:04-08:07): Ross, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?\n(08:08-08:10): That'd be good.\n(08:11-08:14): Really?\n(08:11-08:14): No, go on! It's Paul, the wine guy.\n(08:18-08:21): Hi, come in. Paul, this is...\n(08:22-08:24): ...everybody. Everybody, this is Paul.\n(08:25-08:26): Paul, the wine guy.\n(08:26-08:30): Wine guy.\n(08:26-08:30): I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?\n(08:30-08:33): Okay. Sit down. Two seconds.\n(08:37-08:40): Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes.

I'm such an idiot.\n(10:29-10:33): I should've caught on when she went to the dentist four and five times a week.\n(10:34-10:36): I mean, how clean can teeth get?\n(10:36-10:38): My brother's going through that. He's such a mess.\n(10:39-10:40): How did you get through it?\n(10:40-10:44): He might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers.\n(10:44-10:46): Say her\u2026\n(10:44-10:46): Leg?\n(10:46-10:48): Heh. That's one way of going through it, yeah.\n(10:48-10:50): Me, I went for the watch.\n(10:50-10:52): you actually broke her watch?\n(10:53-10:56): Barry, I'm sorry. I am so sorry.\n(10:56-10:58): I know you probably think it's about what I said\n(10:58-11:01): that you making love with your socks on, but it isn't.\n(11:01-11:04): It isn't, it's about me. And I...\n(11:11-11:14): Hi. Machine cut me off again. Anyway...\n(11:16-11:17): You know what's scary?\n(11:17-11:20): What if there's only one woman for everybody?\n(11:20-11:24): I mean, what if you get one woman, and that's it?\n(11:24-11:29): Unfortunately, in my case, there was only one woman for her.\n(11:29-11:32): What are you talking about? One woman.\n(11:33-11:37): That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you.\n(11:37-11:40): Let me tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there.\n(11:41-11:45): There's rocky road and cookie dough and bing cherry vanilla.\n(11:46-11:50): You can get them with jimmies or nuts or whipped cream.\n(11:50-11:53): This is the best thing that ever happened to you.\n(11:53-11:56): You got married. You were like, what, eight?\n(11:58-12:02): Welcome back to the world. Grab a spoon.\n(12:02-12:05): I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.\n(12:05-12:07): Then stay out of my freezer.\n(12:10-12:14): Ever since she walked out on me, I...\n(12:14-12:16): What? What?\n(12:16-12:18): You wanna spell it out with noodles?\n(12:18-12:22): No, it's more of a fifth date kind of revelation.\n(12:23-12:26): Oh, so there's gonna be a fifth date?\n(12:27-12:29): Isn't there?\n(12:29-12:31): Yeah, yeah. I think there is.\n(12:33-12:35): What were you gonna say?\n(12:37-12:39): Well... Er, uh...\n(12:40-12:42): Ever since she left me, um...\n(12:43-12:46): ...I haven't been able to perform...\n(12:47-12:48): ...sexually.\n(12:51-12:52): Oh, God! Oh, God! I am so...\n(12:53-12:54): I'm so sorry.\n(12:53-12:54): It's okay.\n(12:54-12:57): Being spit on is probably not what you need right now.\n(13:00-13:01): How long?\n(13:01-13:02): Two years.\n(13:05-13:08): I'm glad you smashed her watch.\n(13:10-13:14): So you still think you might want that fifth date?\n(13:16-13:18): Yeah.\n(13:18-13:20): Yeah, I do.\n(13:25-13:28): Oh!See.\n(13:28-13:33): But Joanie loved Chachi. That's the difference.\n(13:35-13:36): Grab a spoon.\n(13:37-13:39): Do you know long it's been since I grabbed a spoon?\n(13:40-13:42): Do the words, \"Billy, don't be a hero,\" mean anything to you?\n(13:45-13:49): You know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough...\n(13:49-13:52): ...to ask a woman out...\n(13:52-13:55): ...who am I gonna ask?\n(14:16-14:17): Isn't this amazing?\n(14:18-14:20): I mean, I have never made coffee before in my life.\n(14:20-14:23): That is amazing.\n(14:20-14:23): Congratulations.\n(14:23-14:28): While you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make a Western omelet or something...\n(14:30-14:34): Although, actually I'm really not that hungry this morning.\n(14:35-14:36): Good morning.\n(14:36-14:38): morning.\n(14:39-14:41): Morning, Paul.\n(14:41-14:44): Hello, Paul.\n(14:41-14:44): Hi.

Would I have seen you in anything?\n(15:44-15:46): Oh, I doubt it. Mostly regional work.\n(15:46-15:50): Unless you happened to catch the Wee One's production of Pinocchio.\n(15:50-15:53): Look, Geppeto. I'm a real live boy.\n(15:56-15:57): I will not take this abuse.\n(15:57-15:59): You're right.
