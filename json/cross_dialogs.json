        "0": "(00:49-00:52): There's nothing to tell. It's just some guy I work with.\n(00:52-00:55): Come on. You're going out with a guy.\n(00:55-00:57): There's gotta be something wrong with him.\n(00:58-00:59): So does he have a hump and a hair piece?\n(01:02-01:04): Wait. Does he eat chalk?\n(01:05-01:08): I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl. Oh.\n(01:08-01:11): Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date.\n(01:11-01:14): It's just two people going out to dinner and not having sex.\n(01:14-01:16): Sounds like a date to me.\n(01:19-01:21): I'm back in high school, in the middle of the cafeteria...\n(01:22-01:25): ...and I realize I'm totally naked.\n(01:25-01:27): Oh, yeah. I've had that dream.\n(01:27-01:31): Then I look down and I realize there is a phone...\n(01:32-01:34): ...there.\n(01:34-01:36): Instead of\u2026\n(01:34-01:36): That's right!\n(01:37-01:38): That one, I've never had.\n(01:37-01:38): No.\n(01:38-01:42): All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.\n(01:43-01:44): And it turns out it's my mother.\n(01:46-01:50): Which is very, very weird because she never calls me.\n(01:55-01:57): Hi.\n(01:58-02:01): This guy says \"hello,\" I wanna kill myself.\n(02:02-02:03): Are you okay, sweetie?\n(02:03-02:05): I feel like someone reached my throat,\n(02:05-02:08): grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth...\n(02:08-02:11):  ...and tied it around my neck.\n(02:08-02:11): Cookie?\n(02:13-02:14): Carol moved her stuff out today.\n(02:16-02:18): Let me get you some coffee.\n(02:16-02:18): Thanks.\n(02:22-02:26): No. No, don't! Stop cleansing my aura.\n(02:27-02:29): Just leave my aura alone, okay?\n(02:31-02:34): I'll be fine. All right? Really. I hope she'll be very happy.\n(02:34-02:36): No, you don't.\n(02:34-02:36): No, I don't.\n(02:36-02:38): To hell with her. She left me!\n(02:39-02:41): And you never knew she was a lesbian.\n(02:45-02:47): No! Okay?\n(02:47-02:50): Why does everyone keep fixating on that?\n(02:51-02:54): She didn't know. How should I know?\n(02:56-02:59): Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.\n(03:00-03:02): Did I say that out loud?\n(03:04-03:08): All right, Ross. Look, you're feeling a lot of pain right now.\n(03:09-03:11): You're angry. You're hurting.\n(03:11-03:13): Can I tell you what the answer is?\n(03:14-03:15): Strip joints!\n(03:17-03:19): Come on, you're single. Have some hormones.\n(03:20-03:22): See, but I don't want to be single, okay?\n(03:22-03:25): I just wanna be married again.\n(03:29-03:33): And I just want a million dollars!\n(03:34-03:35): Rachel?\n(03:35-03:38): Oh, God, Monica! Hi! Thank God!\n(03:38-03:41): I went to your building and this guy with a hammer said...\n(03:41-03:43): ...that you might be here, and you are.\n(03:44-03:47): Can I get you some coffee?\n(03:44-03:47): Decaf.\n(03:48-03:52): Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor.\n(03:52-03:54): This is everybody. This is Chandler and Phoebe...\n(03:55-03:57): ...and Joey. And remember my brother, Ross?\n(03:57-03:58): Sure!\n(03:57-03:58): Hey.\n(04:08-04:09): So you wanna tell us now,\n(04:09-04:12): or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?\n(04:14-04:19): Oh, God! Well, it started about a half-hour before the wedding.\n(04:19-04:21): I was in this room with all the presents...\n(04:22-04:23): ...and I was looking at this gravy boat.\n(04:24-04:27): This really gorgeous Limoges gravy boat.\n(04:27-04:29): When all of a sudden... Sweet 'N Low?\n(04:29-04:31): I realized...\n(04:32-04:35): ...I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry.\n(04:36-04:39): Then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me:\n(04:39-04:42): How much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head.\n(04:42-04:45): You know, I mean, I always knew he looked familiar, but...\n(04:47-04:51): Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering:\n(04:51-04:55): Why am I doing this? And \"Who am I doing this for?\"\n(04:55-04:59): Anyway, I just didn't know where to go, and I know you and I have drifted apart...\n(04:59-05:02): ...but you're the only person I know in the city.\n(05:02-05:04): Who wasn't invited to the wedding.\n(05:04-05:07): Oh, I was kind of hoping that wouldn't be an issue.\n(05:22-05:24): I'm guessing he bought her the big pipe organ...\n(05:24-05:27): ...and she's really not happy about it.\n(05:28-05:31): Daddy, I just... I can't marry him.\n(05:31-05:33): I'm sorry.\n(05:33-05:36): I just don't love him.\n(05:36-05:39): Well, it matters to me.\n(05:42-05:44): She should not be wearing those pants.\n(05:45-05:47): I say push her down the stairs.\n(05:47-05:50): Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!\n(05:55-05:57): Come on, Daddy, listen to me!\n(05:57-06:01): It's like all of my life, everyone's always told me, \"You're a shoe!\n(06:02-06:04): You're a shoe! You're a shoe! You're a shoe!\"\n(06:04-06:07): Then today I stopped and said, \"What if I don't wanna be a shoe?\n(06:07-06:10): What if I wanna be a purse? You know?\n(06:11-06:12): Or a hat?\"\n(06:13-06:16): I don't want you to buy me a hat, I am a hat.\n(06:16-06:18): It's a metaphor, Daddy!\n(06:20-06:22): You can see where he'd have trouble.\n(06:25-06:27): Look, Daddy, it's my life.\n(06:28-06:31): Well, maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.\n(06:34-06:36): I guess we've established she's staying with Monica.\n(06:38-06:41): Well, maybe that's my decision.\n(06:42-06:44): Well, maybe I don't need your money.\n(06:44-06:46): Wait! Wait! I said maybe!\n(06:53-06:56): Okay. Just breathe, that's it.\n(06:56-06:58): Just try to think of nice, calm things.\n(06:59-07:02): Raindrops on roses And whiskers on kittens\n(07:03-07:07): Doorbells and sleigh bells And something with mittens\n(07:07-07:11): La la la something With string\n(07:11-07:13): I'm all better now.\n(07:15-07:17): I helped.\n(07:18-07:21): Look, this is probably for the best, you know?\n(07:21-07:24): Independence. Taking control of your life.\n(07:24-07:28): And, hey, if you need anything, you can always come to Joey.\n(07:28-07:32): Me and Chandler live right across the hall. And he's away a lot.\n(07:34-07:36): Joey, stop hitting on her. It's her wedding day.\n(07:36-07:39): What? Like there's a rule or something?\n(07:41-07:44): Please don't do that again. It's a horrible sound.\n(07:45-07:47): Uh, it's Paul.\n(07:45-07:47): Buzz him in.\n(07:47-07:50): Who's Paul?\n(07:47-07:50): Paul, the wine guy, Paul?\n(07:50-07:51): Maybe.\n(07:51-07:54): Wait a minute. Your \"not a real date\" is with Paul, the wine guy?\n(07:55-07:56): He finally asked you out?\n(07:55-07:56): Yes.\n(07:56-07:59): Ooh. This is a \"Dear Diary\" moment.\n(08:00-08:01): Rach, wait, I can cancel.\n(08:02-08:03): Please, no. Go, I'll be fine.\n(08:04-08:07): Ross, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?\n(08:08-08:10): That'd be good.\n(08:11-08:14): Really?\n(08:11-08:14): No, go on! It's Paul, the wine guy.\n(08:18-08:21): Hi, come in. Paul, this is...\n(08:22-08:24): ...everybody. Everybody, this is Paul.\n(08:25-08:26): Paul, the wine guy.\n(08:26-08:30): Wine guy.\n(08:26-08:30): I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?\n(08:30-08:33): Okay. Sit down. Two seconds.\n(08:37-08:40): Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.\n(08:42-08:44): So, Rachel, what are you up to tonight?\n(08:45-08:49): Well, I was supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon...\n(08:49-08:50): ...so, nothing.\n(08:52-08:54): Right. You're not even getting your honeymoon.\n(08:55-08:59): God. No, no. Although, Aruba. Heh. This time of year? Eh.\n(08:59-09:01): Talk about your...\n(09:02-09:03): ...big lizards.\n(09:07-09:10): Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight...\n(09:10-09:13): ...Joey and Chandler are helping me with my furniture.\n(09:13-09:17): Yes, and we're very excited about it.\n(09:17-09:20): Actually, thanks, but I'm just gonna hang out here tonight.\n(09:20-09:22):  It's been a long day.\n(09:20-09:22): Oh, sure. Okay. Sure.\n(09:22-09:24): Hey, Pheebs, you wanna help?\n(09:24-09:27): Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.\n(09:34-09:39): I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things...\n(09:39-09:42): ...using a bunch of these little worm guys.\n(09:43-09:48): I have no brackety thing, I see no worm guys whatsoever...\n(09:48-09:51): ...and I cannot feel my legs.\n(09:53-09:54): What's this?\n(09:54-09:57): I have no idea.\n(09:59-10:01): Done with the bookcase.\n(09:59-10:01): All finished.\n(10:05-10:06): This was Carol's favorite beer.\n(10:09-10:11): She always drank it out of the can. I should have known.\n(10:11-10:15): Hey. Ross, let me ask you a question.\n(10:15-10:19): She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV.\n(10:19-10:20): What did you get?\n(10:20-10:22): You guys.\n(10:22-10:24): Oh, God. Oh, my God.\n(10:22-10:24): you got screwed.\n(10:24-10:28): Oh, my God.\n(10:24-10:28):  I know, I know. I'm such an idiot.\n(10:29-10:33): I should've caught on when she went to the dentist four and five times a week.\n(10:34-10:36): I mean, how clean can teeth get?\n(10:36-10:38): My brother's going through that. He's such a mess.\n(10:39-10:40): How did you get through it?\n(10:40-10:44): He might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers.\n(10:44-10:46): Say her\u2026\n(10:44-10:46): Leg?\n(10:46-10:48): Heh. That's one way of going through it, yeah.\n(10:48-10:50): Me, I went for the watch.\n(10:50-10:52): you actually broke her watch?\n(10:53-10:56): Barry, I'm sorry. I am so sorry.\n(10:56-10:58): I know you probably think it's about what I said\n(10:58-11:01): that you making love with your socks on, but it isn't.\n(11:01-11:04): It isn't, it's about me. And I...\n(11:11-11:14): Hi. Machine cut me off again. Anyway...\n(11:16-11:17): You know what's scary?\n(11:17-11:20): What if there's only one woman for everybody?\n(11:20-11:24): I mean, what if you get one woman, and that's it?\n(11:24-11:29): Unfortunately, in my case, there was only one woman for her.\n(11:29-11:32): What are you talking about? One woman.\n(11:33-11:37): That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you.\n(11:37-11:40): Let me tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there.\n(11:41-11:45): There's rocky road and cookie dough and bing cherry vanilla.\n(11:46-11:50): You can get them with jimmies or nuts or whipped cream.\n(11:50-11:53): This is the best thing that ever happened to you.\n(11:53-11:56): You got married. You were like, what, eight?\n(11:58-12:02): Welcome back to the world. Grab a spoon.\n(12:02-12:05): I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.\n(12:05-12:07): Then stay out of my freezer.\n(12:10-12:14): Ever since she walked out on me, I...\n(12:14-12:16): What? What?\n(12:16-12:18): You wanna spell it out with noodles?\n(12:18-12:22): No, it's more of a fifth date kind of revelation.\n(12:23-12:26): Oh, so there's gonna be a fifth date?\n(12:27-12:29): Isn't there?\n(12:29-12:31): Yeah, yeah. I think there is.\n(12:33-12:35): What were you gonna say?\n(12:37-12:39): Well... Er, uh...\n(12:40-12:42): Ever since she left me, um...\n(12:43-12:46): ...I haven't been able to perform...\n(12:47-12:48): ...sexually.\n(12:51-12:52): Oh, God! Oh, God! I am so...\n(12:53-12:54): I'm so sorry.\n(12:53-12:54): It's okay.\n(12:54-12:57): Being spit on is probably not what you need right now.\n(13:00-13:01): How long?\n(13:01-13:02): Two years.\n(13:05-13:08): I'm glad you smashed her watch.\n(13:10-13:14): So you still think you might want that fifth date?\n(13:16-13:18): Yeah.\n(13:18-13:20): Yeah, I do.\n(13:25-13:28): Oh!See.\n(13:28-13:33): But Joanie loved Chachi. That's the difference.\n(13:35-13:36): Grab a spoon.\n(13:37-13:39): Do you know long it's been since I grabbed a spoon?\n(13:40-13:42): Do the words, \"Billy, don't be a hero,\" mean anything to you?\n(13:45-13:49): You know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough...\n(13:49-13:52): ...to ask a woman out...\n(13:52-13:55): ...who am I gonna ask?\n(14:16-14:17): Isn't this amazing?\n(14:18-14:20): I mean, I have never made coffee before in my life.\n(14:20-14:23): That is amazing.\n(14:20-14:23): Congratulations.\n(14:23-14:28): While you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make a Western omelet or something...\n(14:30-14:34): Although, actually I'm really not that hungry this morning.\n(14:35-14:36): Good morning.\n(14:36-14:38): morning.\n(14:39-14:41): Morning, Paul.\n(14:41-14:44): Hello, Paul.\n(14:41-14:44): Hi.

Why would anybody do something like that?\n(17:37-17:40): We're looking for an answer more sophisticated than:\n(17:40-17:42): To get you into bed.\n(17:43-17:45): Is it me?\n(17:45-17:48): Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs...\n(17:48-17:51): ...and men with severe emotional problems can hear?\n(17:51-17:54): All right, come here.

I'm suggesting Geller Willick Bunch.\n(20:17-20:20): Oh, no. No, no, no. You see what he's doing?\n(20:20-20:22): He knows no one is gonna say all those names.\n(20:22-20:25): He knows they'll wind up calling her Geller. Then he gets his way.\n(20:25-20:27): My way?

Well, it started about a half-hour before the wedding.\n(04:19-04:21): I was in this room with all the presents...\n(04:22-04:23): ...and I was looking at this gravy boat.\n(04:24-04:27): This really gorgeous Limoges gravy boat.\n(04:27-04:29): When all of a sudden... Sweet 'N Low?\n(04:29-04:31): I realized...\n(04:32-04:35): ...I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry.\n(04:36-04:39): Then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me:\n(04:39-04:42): How much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head.\n(04:42-04:45): You know, I mean, I always knew he looked familiar, but...\n(04:47-04:51): Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering:\n(04:51-04:55): Why am I doing this? And \"Who am I doing this for?\"\n(04:55-04:59): Anyway, I just didn't know where to go, and I know you and I have drifted apart...\n(04:59-05:02): ...but you're the only person I know in the city.\n(05:02-05:04): Who wasn't invited to the wedding.\n(05:04-05:07): Oh, I was kind of hoping that wouldn't be an issue.\n(05:22-05:24): I'm guessing he bought her the big pipe organ...\n(05:24-05:27): ...and she's really not happy about it.\n(05:28-05:31): Daddy, I just... I can't marry him.\n(05:31-05:33): I'm sorry.\n(05:33-05:36): I just don't love him.\n(05:36-05:39): Well, it matters to me.\n(05:42-05:44): She should not be wearing those pants.\n(05:45-05:47): I say push her down the stairs.\n(05:47-05:50): Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!\n(05:55-05:57): Come on, Daddy, listen to me!\n(05:57-06:01): It's like all of my life, everyone's always told me, \"You're a shoe!\n(06:02-06:04): You're a shoe! You're a shoe! You're a shoe!\"\n(06:04-06:07): Then today I stopped and said, \"What if I don't wanna be a shoe?\n(06:07-06:10): What if I wanna be a purse?

Wait! I said maybe!\n(06:53-06:56): Okay. Just breathe, that's it.\n(06:56-06:58): Just try to think of nice, calm things.\n(06:59-07:02): Raindrops on roses And whiskers on kittens\n(07:03-07:07): Doorbells and sleigh bells And something with mittens\n(07:07-07:11): La la la something With string\n(07:11-07:13): I'm all better now.\n(07:15-07:17): I helped.\n(07:18-07:21): Look, this is probably for the best, you know?\n(07:21-07:24): Independence. Taking control of your life.\n(07:24-07:28): And, hey, if you need anything, you can always come to Joey.\n(07:28-07:32): Me and Chandler live right across the hall. And he's away a lot.\n(07:34-07:36): Joey, stop hitting on her. It's her wedding day.\n(07:36-07:39): What? Like there's a rule or something?\n(07:41-07:44): Please don't do that again.

Oh, my God.\n(10:22-10:24): you got screwed.\n(10:24-10:28): Oh, my God.\n(10:24-10:28):  I know, I know. I'm such an idiot.\n(10:29-10:33): I should've caught on when she went to the dentist four and five times a week.\n(10:34-10:36): I mean, how clean can teeth get?\n(10:36-10:38): My brother's going through that. He's such a mess.\n(10:39-10:40): How did you get through it?\n(10:40-10:44): He might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers.\n(10:44-10:46): Say her\u2026\n(10:44-10:46): Leg?\n(10:46-10:48): Heh. That's one way of going through it, yeah.\n(10:48-10:50): Me, I went for the watch.\n(10:50-10:52): you actually broke her watch?\n(10:53-10:56): Barry, I'm sorry. I am so sorry.\n(10:56-10:58): I know you probably think it's about what I said\n(10:58-11:01): that you making love with your socks on, but it isn't.\n(11:01-11:04): It isn't, it's about me. And I...\n(11:11-11:14): Hi. Machine cut me off again. Anyway...\n(11:16-11:17): You know what's scary?\n(11:17-11:20): What if there's only one woman for everybody?\n(11:20-11:24): I mean, what if you get one woman, and that's it?\n(11:24-11:29): Unfortunately, in my case, there was only one woman for her.\n(11:29-11:32): What are you talking about? One woman.\n(11:33-11:37): That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you.\n(11:37-11:40): Let me tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there.\n(11:41-11:45): There's rocky road and cookie dough and bing cherry vanilla.\n(11:46-11:50): You can get them with jimmies or nuts or whipped cream.\n(11:50-11:53): This is the best thing that ever happened to you.\n(11:53-11:56): You got married. You were like, what, eight?\n(11:58-12:02): Welcome back to the world. Grab a spoon.\n(12:02-12:05): I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.\n(12:05-12:07): Then stay out of my freezer.\n(12:10-12:14): Ever since she walked out on me, I...\n(12:14-12:16): What? What?\n(12:16-12:18): You wanna spell it out with noodles?\n(12:18-12:22): No, it's more of a fifth date kind of revelation.\n(12:23-12:26): Oh, so there's gonna be a fifth date?\n(12:27-12:29): Isn't there?\n(12:29-12:31): Yeah, yeah. I think there is.\n(12:33-12:35): What were you gonna say?\n(12:37-12:39): Well... Er, uh...\n(12:40-12:42): Ever since she left me, um...\n(12:43-12:46): ...I haven't been able to perform...\n(12:47-12:48): ...sexually.\n(12:51-12:52): Oh, God! Oh, God! I am so...\n(12:53-12:54): I'm so sorry.\n(12:53-12:54): It's okay.\n(12:54-12:57): Being spit on is probably not what you need right now.\n(13:00-13:01): How long?\n(13:01-13:02): Two years.\n(13:05-13:08): I'm glad you smashed her watch.\n(13:10-13:14): So you still think you might want that fifth date?\n(13:16-13:18): Yeah.\n(13:18-13:20): Yeah, I do.\n(13:25-13:28): Oh!See.\n(13:28-13:33): But Joanie loved Chachi.

Even if I could get it together enough...\n(13:49-13:52): ...to ask a woman out...\n(13:52-13:55): ...who am I gonna ask?\n(14:16-14:17): Isn't this amazing?\n(14:18-14:20): I mean, I have never made coffee before in my life.\n(14:20-14:23): That is amazing.\n(14:20-14:23): Congratulations.\n(14:23-14:28): While you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make a Western omelet or something...\n(14:30-14:34): Although, actually I'm really not that hungry this morning.\n(14:35-14:36): Good morning.\n(14:36-14:38): morning.\n(14:39-14:41): Morning, Paul.\n(14:41-14:44): Hello, Paul.\n(14:41-14:44): Hi.

How's the family?\n(26:13-26:15): Marty's still totally paranoid.\n(26:16-26:19): Oh, and... \n(26:16-26:19): Carol, why are you here, Carol?\n(26:20-26:23): I'm pregnant. \n(26:20-26:23): Pregnant.\n(26:30-26:34): Oh. Looks like she didn't leave in such a hurry after all.\n(26:34-26:36): I think this is the episode of Three's Company...\n(26:36-26:39): ...where's there's some kind of misunderstanding.\n(26:42-26:44): Then I've already seen this one.\n(26:46-26:47): Are you through with that? Thanks.\n(26:48-26:50): Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.\n(26:52-26:53): Whose little ball of paper is this?\n(26:54-26:55): Oh, that would be mine.\n(26:55-26:57): See, I wrote a note to myself, then I didn't need it.\n(26:58-27:00): So I balled it up and now I wish I was dead.\n(27:02-27:05): She already fluffed that pillow. Monica, you know, you already fluffed...\n(27:05-27:07): But it's fine.\n(27:08-27:09): Look, I'm sorry.\n(27:09-27:11): I don't want to give them any more ammunition than they have.\n(27:12-27:13): Yes, we know how cruel a parent can be...\n(27:14-27:17): ...about the flatness of a child's pillow.\n(27:17-27:20): Monica? Hi. Um...\n(27:20-27:23): Monica, um, you're scaring me.\n(27:24-27:28): I mean, you're, like, all chaotic and twirly, you know?\n(27:28-27:29): Not in a good way.\n(27:31-27:32): Yeah, calm down.\n(27:32-27:37): You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.\n(27:37-27:41): That's because, as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong.\n(27:41-27:43): You see, he's the prince.\n(27:43-27:47): Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.\n(27:48-27:50): Ew, ew, ew.\n(27:50-27:53): What?\n(27:50-27:53):  Ugly Naked Guy got a ThighMaster.\n(27:56-27:57): Ew.\n(27:58-28:01): Has anybody seen my engagement ring?\n(27:58-28:01): Yeah, it's beautiful.\n(28:06-28:08): Oh, God. Oh, God.\n(28:08-28:08): Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.  \n(28:08-28:08): No, don't touch that.\n(28:14-28:18): Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough having to give it back to him.\n(28:18-28:20): Hi, Barry, remember me? I'm the girl\u2026\n(28:20-28:24): ...that stomped on your heart in front of your entire family.\n(28:24-28:27): Oh, God. Now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring...\n(28:27-28:30): ...which makes it so much harder.\n(28:31-28:33): Easy, Rach, we'll find it. Won't we?\n(28:33-28:35): Oh, yeah.\n(28:33-28:35): Okay, look.\n(28:38-28:39): When did you have it on last?\n(28:39-28:42): Doy. Probably right before she lost it.\n(28:44-28:47): You don't get a lot of \"doy\" these days.\n(28:48-28:51): I know I had it this morning.\n(28:51-28:54): I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...\n(28:55-28:56): Dinah?\n(28:59-29:02): Oh, don't be mad.\n(29:02-29:04): You didn't. \n(29:02-29:04):  Oh, I'm sorry.\n(29:05-29:07): I gave you one job.\n(29:08-29:11): Oh, but look how straight those noodles are.\n(29:12-29:16): Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagna.\n(29:19-29:20): I just can't do it.\n(29:21-29:23): Boys?\n(29:24-29:25): We're going in.\n(29:34-29:35): Hi.\n(29:36-29:38): Oh, that is not a happy \"hi.\"\n(29:38-29:40): Carol's pregnant.\n(29:40-29:42): Oh, I found it.\n(29:44-29:47): Well, what...? What?\n(29:47-29:49): Yeah.\n(29:50-29:51): Do that for another two hours...\n(29:51-29:54): ...you might be where I am right about now.\n(29:55-29:58): Kind of puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?\n(30:01-30:03): Well, now, how do you fit into this whole thing?\n(30:03-30:06): Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved.\n(30:06-30:11): But if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.\n(30:11-30:13): Basically, it's totally up to me.\n(30:13-30:15): She is so great. I miss her.\n(30:21-30:22): What does she mean by \"involved\"?\n(30:22-30:25): I mean, presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.\n(30:27-30:30): Anyway, they want me to go down to this...\n(30:30-30:32): ...sonogram thing with them tomorrow.\n(30:33-30:34): So, what are you gonna do?\n(30:34-30:36): I have no idea.\n(30:36-30:40): No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.\n(30:50-30:51): Well, this is still ruined, right?\n(30:57-31:01): Oh. Martha Lugwin's daughter is gonna call you.\n(31:03-31:06): Mm. What's that curry taste?\n(31:06-31:08): Curry.\n(31:09-31:10): Mm.\n(31:12-31:15): I think they're great. I really do.\n(31:15-31:16): You remember the Lugwins?\n(31:16-31:18): The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?\n(31:19-31:20): They all had a thing for him.\n(31:21-31:22): Oh, Mom.\n(31:22-31:25): I'm sorry. Why is this girl going to call me?\n(31:25-31:29): Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking or food...\n(31:29-31:31): ...or I don't know.\n(31:31-31:33): Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant, so...\n(31:33-31:36): No, Mom. I don't have a restaurant. I work in a restaurant.\n(31:36-31:39): Well, they don't have to know that.\n(31:42-31:44): Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti.\n(31:45-31:46): Yes.\n(31:46-31:48): Oh, we're having spaghetti. That's...\n(31:48-31:50): ...easy.\n(31:52-31:55): I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish on my part...\n(31:55-31:58): ...but were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing?\n(31:58-32:01): Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.\n(32:04-32:08): What that Rachel did to her life. We ran into her parents at the club.\n(32:08-32:10): They were not playing very well.\n(32:11-32:13): I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding...\n(32:13-32:16): ...but $40,000 is a lot of money.\n(32:18-32:22): Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar.\n(32:25-32:28): What's that supposed to mean?\n(32:25-32:28): Nothing.\n(32:28-32:32): It's an expression.\n(32:28-32:32):  No, it's not.\n(32:32-32:33): Don't listen to your mother.\n(32:33-32:35): You're independent and you always have been.\n(32:35-32:38): Even when you were a kid, and you were chubby...\n(32:38-32:41): ...and you had no friends, you were just fine.\n(32:43-32:46): You'd read alone in your room. And your puzzles...\n(32:49-32:53): Look, there are people, like Ross, who need to shoot for the stars.\n(32:53-32:56): With his museum and his papers getting published.\n(32:57-32:59): Other people are satisfied with staying where they are.\n(32:59-33:03): I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.\n(33:06-33:10): And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God...\n(33:10-33:13): ...our little Harmonica doesn't seem to have that problem.\n(33:16-33:18): So, Ross, what's going on with you?\n(33:19-33:23): Any stories? No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?\n(33:24-33:25): Okay, okay.\n(33:27-33:32): Ahem. Look, I, uh... I realize you guys have been wondering...\n(33:32-33:34): ...what exactly happened between Carol and me.\n(33:35-33:37): And so, well, here's the deal.\n(33:39-33:41): Carol's a lesbian.\n(33:43-33:45): She's living with a woman named Susan.\n(33:47-33:50): She's pregnant with my child.\n(33:51-33:54): And she and Susan are going to raise the baby.\n(33:58-34:00): And you knew about this?\n(34:14-34:17): Your folks are really that bad, huh?\n(34:17-34:20): Well, you know, these people are pros.\n(34:22-34:25): They know what they're doing. They take their time.\n(34:25-34:28): They get the job done.\n(34:29-34:33): Boy, I know they say that you can't change your parents.\n(34:33-34:36): Boy, if you could, I'd want yours.\n(34:38-34:39): Must pee.\n(34:41-34:42): You know, it's even worse when you're twins.\n(34:42-34:45): You're a twin? \n(34:42-34:45):  Oh, yeah. We don't speak.\n(34:45-34:48): She's like this high-powered, driven, career-type.\n(34:48-34:50): What does she do?\n(34:48-34:50): She's a waitress.\n(34:52-34:55): All right. You guys, I kind of gotta clean up now.\n(34:55-34:58): Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.\n(34:58-35:02): Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend...\n(35:02-35:04): ...who my parents actually preferred.\n(35:06-35:08): Hit the lights, please.\n(35:15-35:16): How long was I in there?\n(35:18-35:19): I'm just cleaning up.\n(35:20-35:23): Oh, do you, uh...? Do you need any help?\n(35:23-35:26): Um, okay, sure. Thanks.\n(35:32-35:33): Anyway...\n(35:34-35:37): So you nervous about Barry tomorrow?\n(35:37-35:40): Oh, a little. \n(35:37-35:40): Mm-hm.\n(35:41-35:43): a lot. \n(35:41-35:43): Mm-hm.\n(35:43-35:46): So got any advice?\n(35:46-35:49): You know, as someone who's recently been dumped.\n(35:51-35:54): Well, you may want to steer clear of the word \"dumped.\"\n(35:55-36:00): Chances are he's going to be this broken shell of a man. You know?\n(36:00-36:04): So you should try not to look too terrific. I know it'll be hard.\n(36:07-36:12): Or, you know, hey, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring.\n(36:12-36:16): And you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB-GYN.\n(36:19-36:21): You've got Carol tomorrow.\n(36:22-36:24): When did it get so complicated?\n(36:24-36:25): Got me.\n(36:26-36:29): Remember when we were in high school? \n(36:26-36:29):  yeah.\n(36:29-36:31): I mean, didn't you think you' were gonna meet someone...\n(36:31-36:34): ...fall in love, and that'd be it?\n(36:39-36:41): Ross?  \n(36:39-36:41): Yes, yes.\n(36:43-36:47): Oh. Man. I never thought I'd be here.\n(36:54-36:56): Me neither.\n(37:13-37:15): Hi. Sorry I'm late. I got stuck at work.\n(37:16-37:19): There was this big dinosaur thing. Anyway...\n(37:20-37:22): Hi.\n(37:22-37:25): Ross, you Remember Susan. \n(37:22-37:25): How could I forget?\n(37:26-37:27): Ross.\n(37:27-37:30): Hello, Susan.

Robbie's gonna be here for hours.\n(38:30-38:31): Huh?\n(38:34-38:36): So how are you doing?\n(38:37-38:39): I'm...\n(38:39-38:41): I'm okay.\n(38:42-38:43): You look great.\n(38:44-38:45): Yeah, well...\n(38:46-38:48): Dr. Farber, Jason Greenspan's gagging.\n(38:48-38:51): Be right there.

Minnie, if it's a girl.\n(39:37-39:38): As in \"Mouse\"?\n(39:40-39:41): As in my grandmother.\n(39:42-39:45): Still, you say \"Minnie,\" you hear \"Mouse.\"\n(39:47-39:49): How about, um...\n(39:50-39:51): How about \"Julia\"?\n(39:52-39:53): Julia.\n(39:53-39:54): We agreed on Minnie.\n(39:54-39:57): It's funny, um, we agreed we'd spend our lives together.\n(39:57-40:00): Things change. Roll with the punches.\n(40:01-40:03): I believe Julia's on the table.\n(40:05-40:07): Oh. Sorry about that.\n(40:10-40:13): So, what have you been up to?\n(40:13-40:16): Oh.

They haven't quite taken yet.\n(41:02-41:04): And you got lenses.\n(41:05-41:07): But you hate sticking your finger in your eye.\n(41:08-41:09): Not for her.\n(41:10-41:12): Oh.\n(41:13-41:16): Listen, I really wanted to thank you.\n(41:16-41:18): Okay.\n(41:19-41:20): About a month ago, I wanted to hurt you...\n(41:21-41:23): ...more than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life.\n(41:23-41:25): And I'm an orthodontist.\n(41:26-41:27): Wow.\n(41:27-41:31): You know, you were right. I mean, I thought we were happy.\n(41:31-41:32): We weren't happy.\n(41:34-41:36): But with Mindy...\n(41:37-41:38): ...now I'm happy.\n(41:40-41:41): Spit. \n(41:40-41:41): What?\n(41:41-41:43): Me.\n(41:45-41:47): Anyway, um...\n(41:48-41:51): I guess, uh...

What's wrong with Helen?\n(42:09-42:10): Helen Geller?\n(42:11-42:15): I don't think so.\n(42:11-42:15):  Hello, it's not gonna be Helen Geller.\n(42:15-42:16): Thank you.\n(42:17-42:18): No. I mean, it's not Geller.\n(42:19-42:21): What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?\n(42:21-42:26): No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick Bunch.\n(42:28-42:30): Well, wait a minute. Why is she in the title?\n(42:30-42:32): Because it's my baby too.\n(42:32-42:35): That's funny. Really? I don't remember you making any sperm.\n(42:38-42:41): And we all know what a challenge that is.\n(42:41-42:43): Uh-huh. See?\n(42:41-42:43): All right, you two, stop it.\n(42:43-42:45): No, no. She gets a credit. Hey, I'm in there too.\n(42:45-42:49): Honestly. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick Bunch Geller.\n(42:50-42:51): I think that borders on child abuse.\n(42:51-42:55): Of course not. I'm suggesting Geller Willick Bunch.\n(42:55-42:58): Oh, no. No, no, no. You see what he's doing?\n(42:58-43:00): He knows no one is gonna say all those names.\n(43:00-43:03): He knows they'll wind up calling her Geller. Then he gets his way.\n(43:03-43:05): My way? You think this is my way?\n(43:05-43:09): Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being...\n(43:09-43:12): ...this is not my way. You know what? This is too hard.\n(43:13-43:16): Knock, knock. How are we today? Any nausea?\n(43:16-43:18): a little.\n(43:16-43:18): Just a little.\n(43:19-43:24): Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but, uh, thanks for sharing.\n(43:24-43:25): Uh, lie back.\n(43:26-43:28): You know what? I'm gonna go.\n(43:28-43:32): Um, I don't think I can be involved in this particular family thing.\n(43:43-43:45): Oh, my God.\n(43:45-43:46): Look at that.\n(43:46-43:48): I know.\n(43:59-44:01): Well, isn't that amazing?\n(44:04-44:06): What are we supposed to be seeing here?\n(44:08-44:12): I don't know, but I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.\n(44:16-44:19): You know, if you tilt your head to the left and relax your eyes...\n(44:19-44:21): ...it kind of looks like an old potato.\n(44:22-44:25): Then don't do that, all right?\n(44:27-44:28): Monica?\n(44:28-44:30): What do you think?\n(44:30-44:31): Mm-hm.\n(44:33-44:34): Are you welling up?\n(44:34-44:35): no. \n(44:34-44:35):  you are.\n(44:36-44:38): You are.

I really do.\n(44:59-45:02): And, Min, you know, if everything works out...\n(45:02-45:07): ...and you guys end up getting married and having kids and everything...\n(45:07-45:11): ...I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose.\n(45:15-45:19): Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now.\n(45:24-45:26): Hi, guys.\n(45:24-45:26): Hey, Phoebe.\n(45:26-45:27): Hey, oh, how did it go?\n(45:28-45:29): Um, not so good.\n(45:29-45:32): He walked me to the subway and said, \"We should do this again.\"\n(45:32-45:35): Ouch.\n(45:32-45:35): What? He said, \"We should do it again.\"\n(45:35-45:36): That's good, right?\n(45:36-45:39): Uh, no. Loosely translated, \"We should do this again,\" means:\n(45:39-45:41): You will never see me naked.\n(45:43-45:44): Since when?\n(45:44-45:47): Since always. It's, like, dating language.\n(45:48-45:51): You know, like, \"It's not you,\" means, \"It is you.\"\n(45:52-45:53): You're such a nice guy, means:\n(45:54-45:56): I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics\u9225?11\n(45:56-45:58): ...and complaining about them to you.\n(45:59-46:02): Or, you know, um, \"I think we should see other people,\" means:\n(46:02-46:04): Ha, ha, I already am.\n(46:05-46:06): And everybody knows this?\n(46:07-46:09): Oh, yeah. Cushions the blow.\n(46:09-46:11): Like when you're a kid and your parents put your dog to sleep...\n(46:12-46:14): ...and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.\n(46:14-46:17): That's funny. No, because, uh, our parents actually did...\n(46:17-46:20): ...uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.\n(46:20-46:23): Uh, Ross?\n(46:24-46:27): Ha, ha. Hello. The Milner's farm in Connecticut?\n(46:27-46:30): The Milners, they had this unbelievable farm.\n(46:30-46:32): They had horses and rabbits that he could chase.\n(46:33-46:34): And it was...\n(46:37-46:39): Oh, my God. Chi-Chi.\n(47:34-47:37): So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?\n(47:37-47:40): Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over.\n(47:40-47:45): But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die.\n(47:46-47:48): Hey, that was really good.\n(47:46-47:48): Yeah?\n(47:48-47:50): Yeah.\n(47:48-47:50):  Thanks. Let's keep going.\n(47:50-47:55): Okay. \"So, what do you want from me, Dimon? Huh?\"\n(47:57-48:01): I just wanna go back to my cell, because in my cell, I can smoke.\n(48:01-48:03): Smoke away.\n(48:11-48:12): Heh.\n(48:16-48:20): I think this is probably why Dimon smokes in his cell alone.\n(48:21-48:23): What?    \n(48:21-48:23): Relax your hand.\n(48:23-48:25): Let your wrist go.\n(48:25-48:26): Not so much. \n(48:25-48:26): Whoa.\n(48:26-48:28): Hey.\n(48:29-48:31): All right. Now try taking a puff.\n(48:31-48:32): Right.\n(48:34-48:38): Okay, no, give it to me.     \n(48:34-48:38): No, no, no. I'm not giving you a cigarette.\n(48:38-48:41): No, it's fine. It's fine. Look, do you want to get this part or not? Here.\n(48:42-48:45): All right. Now, don't think of it as a cigarette.\n(48:45-48:49): Think of it as the thing that has been missing from your hand.\n(48:50-48:52): When you're holding it, you feel right.\n(48:53-48:55): You feel complete.\n(48:53-48:55):  You miss it?\n(48:55-48:57): No, not so much.\n(48:59-49:01): All right. Now we smoke.\n(49:04-49:06): Oh, my God.\n(49:14-49:15): No, no, no.\n(49:15-49:19): They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb...\n(49:19-49:20): ...to the tip of his index finger.\n(49:27-49:29): That's ridiculous.\n(49:30-49:32): Can I use either thumb?\n(49:34-49:36): All right. Don't tell me, don't tell me.\n(49:37-49:40): Decaf cappuccino for Joey.\n(49:42-49:43): Coffee, black.\n(49:45-49:46): Latte.\n(49:48-49:49): And an iced tea.\n(49:50-49:53): I'm getting pretty good at this.     \n(49:50-49:53): Excellent. That's very good.\n(49:53-49:54): Good for me.\n(50:08-50:11): You okay, Phoebe?    \n(50:13-50:14): What did they do to you?\n(50:14-50:16): It's nothing, it's just... Okay.\n(50:16-50:19): I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly \"statement.\"\n(50:19-50:21): Easy.\n(50:23-50:25): And there's 500 extra dollars in my account.\n(50:25-50:29): Oh, Satan's minions at work again.\n(50:29-50:32): Yes, because now I have to go down there and deal with them...\n(50:32-50:35): What are you talking about? Keep it.     \n(50:32-50:35): It's not mine.\n(50:35-50:38): I didn't earn it. If I kept it, it would be like stealing.\n(50:38-50:42): Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping.\n(50:43-50:44): Okay. Okay.\n(50:44-50:46): Let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes.\n(50:47-50:49): Do you know what I'd hear with every step I took?\n(50:49-50:52): Not mine. Not mine. Not mine.\n(50:52-50:55): And even if I was happy, okay, and skipping...\n(50:55-50:58): ...I'd hear, \"Not mine. Not mine.\"\n(50:58-51:00): We're with you. We got it.\n(51:00-51:05): Okay, I'd never be able to enjoy it. It'd be like this giant karmic debt.\n(51:05-51:08): Chandler, what are you doing? Hey.\n(51:08-51:10): What are you doing?\n(51:13-51:15): Oh, gross.\n(51:16-51:18):  What is this?    \n(51:16-51:18): I'm smoking. I'm smoking. I'm smoking.\n(51:18-51:21): I can't believe you. You've been so good for three years.\n(51:21-51:23): And this is my reward.\n(51:25-51:28): Hold on a second. Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.\n(51:28-51:30): Okay, so this time I won't quit.\n(51:30-51:33): Put it out.     \n(51:30-51:33): All right. I'm putting it out.\n(51:34-51:36): Oh, no.\n(51:36-51:38): I can't drink this now.\n(51:42-51:44): All right, I'm gonna go change. I've got a date.\n(51:44-51:47): Is this Alan again?

Steve was sexy.\n(52:07-52:08): Sorry.\n(52:08-52:12): Look, I don't know how I feel about him yet. Give me a chance to figure it out.\n(52:12-52:14): Well, then can we meet him?\n(52:14-52:15): No.\n(52:15-52:17): Sorry.\n(52:20-52:22): Why should I let them meet him?\n(52:22-52:25): I bring a guy home and within five minutes they're all over him.\n(52:25-52:29): I mean, they're like coyotes picking off the weak members of the herd.\n(52:30-52:34): Listen, as someone who's seen more than her share of bad beef...\n(52:34-52:38): ...I'll tell you, that is not such a terrible thing.\n(52:38-52:41): Come on, they're your friends. They're looking out after you.\n(52:41-52:44): I know, I know. I wish that once I'd bring a guy home they actually liked.\n(52:44-52:48): Well, you do realize that the odds of that happening are a little slimmer...\n(52:48-52:50): ...if they never get to meet the guy.\n(52:52-52:54): Let it go, Ross.\n(52:54-52:56): Yeah?

I have one question: How is that possible?\n(56:27-56:30): Alan. \n(56:27-56:30):  He was unbelievable.\n(56:30-56:33): He was like that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions.\n(56:33-56:37): But instead of Bugs, it was first base, Alan. Second base, Alan...\n(56:41-56:44): I mean, it was like he made us into a team.\n(56:44-56:46): Yep. We sure showed those Hasidic jewelers...\n(56:46-56:49): ...a thing or two about softball. \n(56:46-56:49): Nice.\n(56:50-56:52): Can I ask you guys a question?\n(56:52-56:55): Do you ever think that Alan is maybe sometimes...\n(56:55-56:59): What? \n(56:55-56:59): I don't know. A little too Alan?\n(56:59-57:02): Oh, no. That's not possible. You can never be too Alan.\n(57:03-57:07): Yeah, it's his innate Alan-ness that we adore.\n(57:08-57:10):  I, personally, could have a gallon of Alan. \n(57:16-57:19): Hey, Lizzy.  \n(57:16-57:19): Hey, Weird Girl.\n(57:19-57:22): I brought You alphabet soup. \n(57:19-57:22): did You pick out the vowels?\n(57:22-57:25): Yes, but I left in the Y's.

Thanks.\n(59:09-59:12):  See you.\n(59:18-59:20): Huh.\n(59:20-59:21): A thumb?\n(59:22-59:23): Ew.\n(59:24-59:26): I know, I know. I opened it up and there it was...\n(59:26-59:29): ...just floating in there, like this tiny little hitchhiker.\n(59:31-59:34): Maybe it's a contest, you know? Like \"Collect all five.\"\n(59:36-59:38): Does, um, anyone wanna see?\n(59:38-59:39): No, thanks.\n(59:40-59:43): Oh, hey, don't do that. Come on. \n(59:40-59:43): Cut that out.\n(59:43-59:44): It's worse than the thumb.\n(59:46-59:48): Hey, this is so unfair.\n(59:48-59:53): Why is it unfair? \n(59:48-59:53): so I have a flaw. Big deal.\n(59:53-59:55): Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying?\n(59:56-59:58): And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word.\n(59:58-60:00): And Monica, with that snort when she laughs.\n(60:00-60:03): I mean, what the hell is that thing?\n(60:05-60:08): I accept all those flaws. Why can't you accept me for this?\n(60:15-60:18): Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody, or just him?\n(60:20-60:22): Well...\n(60:22-60:24): ...I could live without it.\n(60:25-60:26): Huh.\n(60:27-60:32): Well, is it, like, a little annoying? Or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?\n(60:34-60:38): Now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, all right? I think it's endearing.\n(60:38-60:40): Oh, you do, do you?\n(60:46-60:49): You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.\n(60:50-60:52): Indeed there isn't.\n(60:55-60:56): I should really get back to work.\n(60:56-61:00): Yeah, otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.\n(61:01-61:05): Oh. The hair comes out and the gloves come off.\n(61:21-61:24): Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?\n(61:25-61:26): No.\n(61:27-61:31): Okay. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like.\n(61:33-61:35): We talking about the coyotes here?\n(61:35-61:39): Heh. All right. A cow got through.\n(61:40-61:41): Can you believe it?\n(61:41-61:43): It's just, you know what?\n(61:43-61:46): I just don't feel the thing.\n(61:46-61:49): I mean, they feel the thing. I don't feel the thing.\n(61:49-61:52): Honey, you should always...\n(61:52-61:54): ...feel the thing.\n(61:57-61:59): Listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him.\n(62:00-62:02): I know, it's just gonna be really hard.\n(62:02-62:04): Yeah, he's a big boy. He'll get over it.\n(62:04-62:09): No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.\n(62:09-62:11): Do you have any respect for your body?\n(62:11-62:13): Don't you realize what you're doing to yourself?\n(62:13-62:16): Hey, you know, I've had it with you and your cancer...\n(62:16-62:18): ...and your emphysema and your heart disease.\n(62:18-62:21): The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.\n(62:24-62:25): Ahem. Chandler?\n(62:26-62:27): It's Alan. He wants to speak to you.\n(62:27-62:29): Really? He does?\n(62:31-62:33): Hey, buddy. What's up?\n(62:35-62:37): Oh, she told you about that, huh?\n(62:38-62:42): Well, yeah. I have one now and then.
