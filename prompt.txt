System: You are an expert in long story video comprehension and now need to put your students to the test by coming up with a series of questions for them to answer.Question for story video comprehension is divided into 2 attributions, 7 topics.Attributions: 'perception', 'inference'.
Description: For questions of 'perception', it can be obtained from the appearance of the video directly, while questions of 'inference' need to analyze the content of the video and logical reasoning to get the results. Therefore, you need to focus on a more long-term understanding of the scripts, such as cross scene, even cross the whole script, generate less question about short-term understanding.
Topics: 'C', 'A', 'L', 'CA', 'CL', 'AL', 'CAL'
Description: We focuses on three core elements of the video: character, action, and location, where C stands for character, A stands for action, and L stands for location. Therefore, there are 7 possible topics, i.e., 'C', 'A', 'L', 'CA', 'CL', 'AL', 'CAL'. It should be attention that there should be only core elements in questions of topic. For example, 'C' can only involve 'character', not anything about 'action' or 'location'. You can only generate question about 'character'.

In order to better validate the question, Please generate the basis of inference, a list of the start and end times of the relevant clips of the video(The span between start and end should be at least 30 seconds because short period contains too less information.) and a list of the relevant characters related to question.

Please note that the video information contains the boundingbox, character, and line and line timestamps. The list of boundingboxes represents the top-left and bottom-right coordinate points, i.e. [top-left x, top-left y, bottom-right x,bottom-right y], and the time span of each boundingbox information is all the lines from the current boundingbox to the next one. If the attribute of a boundingbox is none, then please ignore this information and do not generate questions for this boundingbox. And the frame size is 1920*1080. video information are as follow:
Location:  Central Perk
Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, Phoebe, and Monica are there.
(00:49-00:52) Monica: There's nothing to tell. It's just some guy I work with.

(03:00-03:02) Chandler: Did I say that out loud?
(03:04-03:08) Joey: All right, Ross.

A wrong number?Sorry.
(03:09-03:11) Joey: You're angry. You're hurting.

(04:09-04:12) Monica: or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
(04:14-04:19) Rachel: Oh, God! Well, it started about a half-hour before the wedding.
(04:19-04:21) Rachel: I was in this room with all the presents...
(04:22-04:23) Rachel: ...and I was looking at this gravy boat.

(04:29-04:31) Rachel: I realized...
(04:32-04:35) Rachel: ...I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry.
(04:36-04:39) Rachel: Then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me:
(04:39-04:42) Rachel: How much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head.
(04:42-04:45) Rachel: You know, I mean, I always knew he looked familiar, but...
(04:47-04:51) Rachel: Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering:
(04:51-04:55) Rachel: Why am I doing this? And "Who am I doing this for?"
(04:55-04:59) Rachel: Anyway, I just didn't know where to go, and I know you and I have drifted apart...
(04:59-05:02) Rachel: ...but you're the only person I know in the city.

(48:16-48:20) Chandler: I think this is probably why Dimon smokes in his cell alone.
(48:21-48:23) Joey: What?
(48:21-48:23) Chandler: Relax your hand.
(48:23-48:25) Chandler: Let your wrist go.
Joey lets his wrist go limp.
(48:25-48:26) Chandler: Not so much.

(48:26-48:28) Chandler: Hey.
(48:29-48:31) Chandler: All right. Now try taking a puff.Hey!
(48:31-48:32) Chandler: Right.
Joey tries and visibly winces.
(48:34-48:38) Chandler: Okay, no, give it to me.
(48:34-48:38) Joey: No, no, no. I'm not giving you a cigarette.
(48:38-48:41) Chandler: No, it's fine. It's fine. Look, do you want to get this part or not? Here.
Joey reluctantly gives him the cigarette.
(48:42-48:45) Chandler: All right. Now, don't think of it as a cigarette.
(48:45-48:49) Chandler: Think of it as the thing that has been missing from your hand.
(48:50-48:52) Chandler: When you're holding it, you feel right.
(48:53-48:55) Chandler: You feel complete.
(48:53-48:55) Joey: You miss it?
(48:55-48:57) Chandler: No, not so much.
(48:59-49:01) Chandler: All right. Now we smoke.
(49:04-49:06) Chandler: Oh, my God.
(49:14-49:15) Monica: No, no, no.
(49:15-49:19) Monica: They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb...
(49:19-49:20) Monica: ...to the tip of his index finger.
The guys stretch out their fingers.
(49:27-49:29) Joey: That's ridiculous.
(49:30-49:32) Ross: Can I use either thumb?
(49:34-49:36) Rachel: All right. Don't tell me, don't tell me.

(50:14-50:16) Phoebe: It's nothing, it's just... Okay.
(50:16-50:19) Phoebe: I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly "statement."
(50:19-50:21) Ross: Easy.
(50:23-50:25) Phoebe: And there's 500 extra dollars in my account.
(50:25-50:29) Chandler: Oh, Satan's minions at work again.
(50:29-50:32) Phoebe: Yes, because now I have to go down there and deal with them...
(50:32-50:35) Joey: What are you talking about? Keep it.
(50:32-50:35) Phoebe: It's not mine.
(50:35-50:38) Phoebe: I didn't earn it. If I kept it, it would be like stealing.
(50:38-50:42) Rachel: Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping.
(50:43-50:44) Rachel: Okay. Okay.
(50:44-50:46) Phoebe: Let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes.
(50:47-50:49) Phoebe: Do you know what I'd hear with every step I took?
(50:49-50:52) Phoebe: Not mine. Not mine. Not mine.
(50:52-50:55) Phoebe: And even if I was happy, okay, and skipping...
(50:55-50:58) Phoebe: ...I'd hear, "Not mine. Not mine."
(50:58-51:00) Monica: We're with you. We got it.
Chandler leans over the back of the couch out of sight.
(51:00-51:05) Phoebe: Okay, I'd never be able to enjoy it. It'd be like this giant karmic debt.
(51:05-51:08) Rachel: Chandler, what are you doing? Hey.
(51:08-51:10) Rachel: What are you doing?
Chandler tries to shrug nonchalantly but eventually he has to exhale a mouthful of smoke.
(51:13-51:15) Rachel,Joey,Phoebe,Chandler,Monica,Ross: Oh, gross.Hey. Whaddya doing?
(51:16-51:18) Ross: What is this?

(51:21-51:23) Chandler: And this is my reward.
(51:25-51:28) Ross: Hold on a second. Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.
(51:28-51:30) Chandler: Okay, so this time I won't quit.
(51:30-51:33) Rachel,Joey,Phoebe,Chandler,Monica,Ross: Put it out.

Examples are for reference only, Please generate in the form of reference examples. The specific content of the generated questions should be based on the actual situation of the scripts. In addition, as you can see in related_times of Example, most questions are cover long range of multiple episodes\n\n, so you also should generate questions like these and these example can not be used any more.

Requirements: I hope relevant segments can be cross video clips. I want to generate questions of different difficulty, so for each type you need to help me generate questions of different difficulty by either focusing on more long-term video cip, or focusing on more complex character's relationship. You can even generate questions cover the whole episode. And the generation of questions should ideally be spread throughout the video rather than concentrated in certain scenes. In order to better validate the question, Please generate the basis of inference, a list of the start and end times of the relevant segments in the video, and a list of the relevant characters related to question.

Please generate questions with GroundTruth and choices list in multiple-choice format. For each 2 attributions and 7 topics, i.e., for each of the 14 type, you should generate at least 10 questions and questions should be with different degree of diffculty. You are specialize in using 'Tools_of_saving_quetsion' to save questions and you cane generate about 14 questions and save. Use tool 'Tools_of_saving_quetsion' to save question informations.
