Boundingbox: Chandler: [339, 138, 1075, 1270]
(10:29-10:33) Chandler: They've got wheels that pop out from the bottom so you can roll around...
(10:33-10:36) Chandler: because apparently walking is too much exercise.
(10:37-10:41) Chandler: "Kids! Kids! Roll your way to childhood obesity!"
Boundingbox: Chandler: [468, 138, 1373, 1369]

Boundingbox: Chandler: [405, 148, 1319, 1257]
(10:51-10:53) Chandler: That's not what they're looking for.

(18:30-18:33) Chandler: Just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes.
(18:34-18:37) Chandler: He jumps over the old guy and laughs. And the line reads:

(34:09-34:12) Phoebe: No. Oh, I definitely don't want to get married.
(34:12-34:16) Phoebe: No, I just wanted to make sure you didn't want to, too.

(34:21-34:23) Phoebe: there is gonna be hell to pay, mister.
Boundingbox: Mike: [654, 121, 1525, 1449] Phoebe: [109, 368, 778, 1792]

(76:26-76:27) Ross: Why would I eat my own arm?
Boundingbox: Chandler: [400, 96, 1287, 1593]
(76:27-76:31) Chandler: Well, you wouldn't, but we own the paper. We can print whatever we want.

Boundingbox: none
(77:08-77:12) Ross: I don't know. I'll probably just invest it.

Boundingbox: Chandler: [881, 103, 1605, 1355] Joey: [167, 139, 1033, 1444]
(77:36-77:38) Chandler: I'm not sure a sports team is the way to go.
(77:38-77:42) Joey: You won't let me buy the Knicks? I can't believe you're taking this away.
Boundingbox: Chandler: [682, 118, 1532, 1580]

(78:08-78:09) Ross: Oh.
Boundingbox: Ross: [386, 183, 1292, 1362]
(78:09-78:12) Ross: Although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call me "Daddy" too.
Boundingbox: Phoebe: [822, 106, 1489, 1335]
(78:14-78:16) Phoebe: Mm. I like that, Daddy.
Boundingbox: Ross: [392, 140, 1272, 1326]

Boundingbox: Phoebe: [711, 10, 1384, 1350]
(78:28-78:31) Phoebe: Is Daddy gonna spank me?
Boundingbox: Ross: [356, 126, 1268, 1384]

Boundingbox: Phoebe: [1000, 158, 1276, 945] Ross: [378, 62, 690, 1115]
